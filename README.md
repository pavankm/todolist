# todolist
WIP

##Idea:
I use a few productivity apps whose functionalities I like and would like to combine. 
    This is more of a learning project than it is an attempt to build a product.
 
- Wunderlist
    - task items + lists 
    - reminders 
    - notes
    - sharing lists
    - attachments (I have never used this)
    - calendar integration
- Toggl
    - time tracking 
    - retroactive analysis
- Google calendar
    - fixed time tasks
    - planning

## Things I want to learn from this
- Building APIs using Python/Django
    - I've built APIs using Java/DropWizard before so this will be more of a translation of knowledge
- Data Visualization
    - Visualization is a powerful tool for communication. I want to experiment with different ways of visualizing productivity.
- Projections of data
    - The tasks have the same data structure on disk but they are 'projected' differently on different platforms (calendar, time tracking, todo-list). I want to find a good way to do this.
